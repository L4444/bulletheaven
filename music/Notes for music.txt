"Brought to life" is an excellent song for a boss that encourages stealth, it has an eye/sensor that pops out to try and detect the player with a spotlight.
During that phase it doesn't take damage, so players need to dodge and hide. 
It can also send out drones.


"Power trip 3" could be used when the boss is vulnrable.

"Sutar Rising" just plain slaps, very hard song. Very hard techno. Has a drop in the middle, good for 2nd phase of regular combat.
